 Using Stacked Gradient  Boosting (SGB) to determine the nature of breast tumors. Our approach leverages three machine learning algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbor  (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF) using the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer dataset, with an average accuracy of  98.25%.
